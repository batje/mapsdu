Mapsdu
========================

This is the theme for maps.data.ug

There are 2 .css files

- bootstrap.css contains our bootstrap.css that is generated by the .less compiler on www.data.ug. Most of the styling should come from that.
- site_base.css has overwrites that mainly target geonode specific HTML styled elements that are styled through base.ss in the main theme.

The ultimate goal would be to have bootstrap.css contain all css for www maps and catalog.data.ug

There are 2 html files

- base.html This file should not be there, but I started making some edits
